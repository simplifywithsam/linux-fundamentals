# Logical Volume Manager

VM, or Logical Volume Manager, is a technology used in Linux and some other Unix-like operating systems to manage storage devices and create flexible storage solutions. LVM provides a layer of abstraction between physical storage devices (such as hard drives or SSDs) and the file systems or partitions that use them. This abstraction allows for easier management of storage resources and provides features like dynamic resizing, snapshots, and more.

Here are the key concepts and components of LVM in Linux:

## Physical Volumes (PVs): 
A physical volume is a physical storage device or a partition on a storage device. LVM aggregates one or more physical volumes into a Volume Group.

## Volume Groups (VGs): 
A volume group is a logical container that groups one or more physical volumes together. It represents a pool of storage resources from which you can create logical volumes.

## Logical Volumes (LVs): 
A logical volume is a virtual partition that is created within a volume group. It can be thought of as similar to a traditional disk partition, but with added flexibility. Logical volumes can be resized dynamically without needing to repartition the physical disks.

## Extents: 
An extent is a fixed-size block of storage within a volume group. Logical volumes are composed of one or more extents. The size of an extent is configurable during the creation of a volume group.

## LVM Commands:

	pvcreate: Initializes a physical volume.
	vgcreate: Creates a volume group.
	lvcreate: Creates a logical volume within a volume group.
	lvextend and lvreduce: Resize logical volumes.
	pvmove: Moves data between physical volumes.
	lvcreate --snapshot: Creates a snapshot of a logical volume.
	
File Systems: After creating logical volumes, you can format them with file systems (e.g., ext4, XFS) and then mount them to use as regular storage.

## LVM provides several advantages, including:

####	Dynamic Resizing: 
You can easily extend or shrink logical volumes online without disrupting data access.
####	Data Protection: 
LVM supports mirroring and striping, which can provide data redundancy and improved performance.
####	Snapshots: 
You can create read-only snapshots of logical volumes for backup purposes or to create a point-in-time copy of data.
####	LVM allows for efficient management of storage resources, even when using multiple physical disks.

To use LVM, you need to install the LVM tools package on your Linux distribution (e.g., lvm2), initialize physical volumes, create volume groups, and then create and manage logical volumes as needed. It's a powerful tool for managing storage in Linux systems, especially in environments where storage requirements may change over time.

#		LVM commands with examples:

##		pvcreate: Initialize a physical volume.
		pvcreate /dev/sdb   # Initializes /dev/sdb as a physical volume

##		vgcreate: Create a volume group.
		vgcreate myvg /dev/sdb /dev/sdc   # Creates a volume group named "myvg" using /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc as physical volumes

##		lvcreate: Create a logical volume within a volume group.
		lvcreate -n mylv -L 10G myvg   # Creates a logical volume named "mylv" with a size of 10GB in the "myvg" volume group

##		lvextend: Extend the size of a logical volume.
		lvextend -L +5G /dev/myvg/mylv   # Increases the size of "mylv" by 5GB

##		lvreduce: Reduce the size of a logical volume.
		lvreduce -L 2G /dev/myvg/mylv   # Reduces the size of "mylv" to 2GB

##		lvremove: Remove a logical volume.
		lvremove /dev/myvg/mylv   # Removes the logical volume "mylv"

##		vgextend: Add physical volumes to an existing volume group.
		vgextend myvg /dev/sdd   # Adds /dev/sdd to the "myvg" volume group

##		vgreduce: Remove physical volumes from a volume group.
		vgreduce myvg /dev/sdd   # Removes /dev/sdd from the "myvg" volume group

##		pvmove: Move data from one physical volume to another.
		pvmove /dev/sdb /dev/sde   # Moves data from /dev/sdb to /dev/sde

##		lvcreate --snapshot: Create a snapshot of a logical volume.
		lvcreate -s -n mysnapshot -L 2G /dev/myvg/mylv   # Creates a read-only snapshot of "mylv" named "mysnapshot" with a size of 2GB

##		lvdisplay: Display information about logical volumes.
		lvdisplay   # Shows information about all logical volumes

##		vgdisplay: Display information about volume groups.
		vgdisplay   # Shows information about all volume groups

##		pvdisplay: Display information about physical volumes.
		pvdisplay   # Shows information about all physical volumes

		These commands allow you to create, manage, and manipulate logical volumes and volume groups in your LVM setup. Make sure to exercise caution when using these commands, especially when resizing or removing logical volumes or volume groups, as data loss can occur if not done correctly. Always back up important data before making major changes to your storage configuration.
