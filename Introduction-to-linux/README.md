Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system.

What is Linux and why should I use it?

Linux is an operating system (OS), which is the primary software that a computer uses to execute tasks and communicate directions to its hardware. 
The operating system that competes the most with Linux is Windows. 
Linux is a popular and widely-used OS because it is open-source, meaning that it is free to the public, and anyone can modify and customize Linux software as they wish. 
The reasons to use Linux can vary from developing an app or building a video game to learning how to hack computer systems. 
As Linux is one of the most popular operating systems, many developers use it to develop their web applications and software programs. 
This means knowledge of Linux is important for anyone working with computers and software in general. 
Learning how to work with Linux is a necessary skill for anyone pursuing a career in ethical hacking or penetration testing.


What are Shells?

The shell is an interactive interface that allows users to execute other commands and utilities in Linux and other UNIX-based operating systems. 


Linux Signs ($, #, %, ~):

In short, if the screen shows a dollar sign ($) or hash (#) on the left of the blinking cursor, you are in a command-line environment.
$, #, % symbols indicate the user account type you are logged in to.
The dollar sign ($) means you are a normal user.
Hash (#) means you are the system administrator (root).
In the C shell, the prompt ends with a percentage sign (%).
