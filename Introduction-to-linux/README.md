Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system.

What is Linux and why should I use it?

Linux is an operating system (OS), which is the primary software that a computer uses to execute tasks and communicate directions to its hardware. 
The operating system that competes the most with Linux is Windows. 
Linux is a popular and widely-used OS because it is open-source, meaning that it is free to the public, and anyone can modify and customize Linux software as they wish. 
The reasons to use Linux can vary from developing an app or building a video game to learning how to hack computer systems. 
As Linux is one of the most popular operating systems, many developers use it to develop their web applications and software programs. 
This means knowledge of Linux is important for anyone working with computers and software in general. 
Learning how to work with Linux is a necessary skill for anyone pursuing a career in ethical hacking or penetration testing.


What are Shells?

The shell is an interactive interface that allows users to execute other commands and utilities in Linux and other UNIX-based operating systems. 


Linux Signs ($, #, %, ~):

In short, if the screen shows a dollar sign ($) or hash (#) on the left of the blinking cursor, you are in a command-line environment.
$, #, % symbols indicate the user account type you are logged in to.
The dollar sign ($) means you are a normal user.
Hash (#) means you are the system administrator (root).
In the C shell, the prompt ends with a percentage sign (%).


What is Unix ?
The Unix operating system is a set of programs that act as a link between the computer and the user.

The computer programs that allocate the system resources and coordinate all the details of the computer's internals is called the operating system or the kernel.

Users communicate with the kernel through a program known as the shell. The shell is a command line interpreter; it translates commands entered by the user and converts them into a language that is understood by the kernel.

    Unix was originally developed in 1969 by a group of AT&T employees Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna at Bell Labs.

    There are various Unix variants available in the market. Solaris Unix, AIX, HP Unix and BSD are a few examples. Linux is also a flavor of Unix which is freely available.

    Several people can use a Unix computer at the same time; hence Unix is called a multiuser system.

    A user can also run multiple programs at the same time; hence Unix is a multitasking environment.
